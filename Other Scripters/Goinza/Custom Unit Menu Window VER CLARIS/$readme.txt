Custom Unit Menu Window
By Goinza
Version 2.3
August 11, 2020

-NOTE FROM CLARIS: READ UNDER GOINZA'S INSTRUCTIONS FOR MODIFICATION INFO-

This plugin allows to change the default bottom window of the unit menu screen, so you can show data from the unit that is not available by default.
You can also add more windows, with each window showing differen data of the unit.
The data that will be displayed will be choosen by the user from the list of data that was added to the plugin.
You don't need to use custom parameters and you don't need to know about progamming. To modify the window, you only need to change some options (more detailed instructions below).
For example, you can make windows show things like races, states, class type, among other things.

HOW THE WINDOWS WORKS
The windows are divided into four sectors: top left, top right, bottom left and bottom right.
Each of these sector can hold one type of data. In particular, the top sectors are bigger than the bottom ones, so they can have more detailed information. 
For example, if you insert the races in a top sector, you can see the name and icon of the race, but if you add it to a bottom sector, you can only see the icon.
Note that not all data is available in all sectors. Some are exclusive to top and some to bottom.
In addition to that, most data can be selected, which allows to show the description of the data below the window. In the example used above, it would show
the description of the selected race.

HOW TO ASSIGN DATA TO EACH SECTOR
To assign data to a sector, you need to open the _config.js file with a text editor like Notepad. In there, you will find some variables.
The variables TOP_OPTIONS and BOTTOM_OPTIONS have the data available to use, while the Options variable is where you can assign one of those data options.
Notice that each variable is not just a value, but an array of values. This is done like this so each value represents the data from that section of each window.
For example, if the TOPLEFT value has [TopRaceInteraction, GrowthInteraction] it means that the first window will have a list of races at the top left,
and the second window will have a list of the growths of that unit.
Before modifyin those values, make sure to define the value you want for WINDOWS_COUNT, which determines the amount of windows the screen will have.
Also, make sure that each array has the same amount of elements as the amount of windows defined in WINDOWS_COUNT.
Now, here is a list of all the possible values for the top and bottom sections:
    - TOP_OPTIONS: this is an array containing with all the options available for top sectors:
        - NullInteraction: Empty space. Used when you don't want to fill this sector with data.
        - InventoryInteraction: List of weapons and items that the unit has in its inventory.
        - StatsInteraction: Current stats of the unit. It doesn't include the HP stat.
        - AltStatsInteraction: Alternative version of StatsInteraction. The difference is that it has 3 columns instead of 2.
            Useful if you have too many stats and they don't fit in the window.
        - TopWeaponTypeInteraction: List of weapon types available to the unit. Shows icon and name.
        - TopSkillInteraction: List of skills of the unit. Shows icon and name.
        - TopRaceInteraction: Races list. Shows name and icon.
        - TopStateInteraction: States list. While by default the game shows the current states of an unit, this will let you see its name and description.
        - GrowthInteraction: Unit's growth values.
        - PlayerGrowthInteraction: An alternative version of GrowthInteraction. It is the same, but this one is only displayed for units of the player's army.
        - SupportInteraction: Supports list.
        - TopTraitsInteraction: List of traits. This only works if you also have the plugin "Traits System" installed.
        - CustomCombatArtsInteraction: List of combat arts. This only works if you also have the plugin "Combat Arts" installed.
        - CustomSpellsInteraction: List of weapons and items from Orignal Data entries. This only works with the plugin "Weapons and Items as Original Data" installed.
    - BOTTOM_OPTIONS: this is an array containing with all the options available for bottom sectors:
        - NullInteraction: Empty space. Used when you don't want to fill this sector with data.
        - BottomWeaponTypeInteraction: List of weapon types available to the unit. Shows icon.
        - BottomSkillInteraction: List of skills of the unit. Shows icon.
        - BottomRaceInteraction: Races list. Shows icon.
        - BottomStateInteraction: States list. While by default the game shows the current states of an unit, this will let you see its description.
        - ClassTypeInteraction: Class type of the unit's current class. Shows name and icon.
        - BottomTraitsInteraction: List of traits. This only works if you also have the plugin "Traits System" installed.
    - Options: this variable has 4 fields, where each field correspond to one of the window's sectors.
        Each field has its name explaning the sector that will be assigned, for example the field TOPLEFT is assigned to the top left sector. 
        There are two way to assign a value to the field:
            You can do something like TOP_OPTIONS[2], in this case you are using the third value found in the array of TOP_OPTIONS.
                Note that the index starts with zero, so the first element is TOP_OPTIONS[0], the second TOP_OPTIONS[1], and so on.
            The other option is to directly specify the name of the data, like for example writing BottomRaceInteraction or BottomStateInteraction.
        There is also two other fields: WINDOWS_COUNT and SECTION_DISTANCE. The first one was already explained before,
            and the other sets the distance between the top and bottom sections. By default the value is 0, but it can be changed if your menu window has a differnt size than the default value.
            Use a positive number to increase the distance and a negative number to decrease the distance between the top and bottom sections.

ABOUT THE SECTIONS OF STATS AND GROWTHS
If you use the StatsInteraction, AltStatsInteraction and/or GrowthInteraction, you will notice that you can't select each stat to check their description.
That is the default behaviour, but it can be changed. To enable this, set true to the variable ENABLE_STAT_DESCRIPTION in the _config.js file
To do this, you need to create and Original Data entry for each stat. Each entry must have exactly the same name as the stat, and you can write the description in the Description field.
All entries must be in the same tab, which will be specified by the STAT_TAB variable. Note that the value zero means the first tab, one is for the second tab, and so on.

INCOMPATIBILIY ISSUES
This plugin is compatible with all other plugins, except for one part: 
the UnitMenuBottomWindow object is completely replaced for another, so any plugin relying on that object may have problems.
